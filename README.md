## About Gomoku Game
Gomoku is a two-player board game. Each player has a type of stone, black or white. 
In each turn, a player places a stone at a corner in the board. 
The winner must have a line of first five adjacent stones vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. 
This line must not be blocked at both ends. The edge of the board is considered as a blocked end. 

## Features

• Players can select the size of the board before starting the game.

• There are 10 minutes for each player at the beginning. At this stage, there is no time limit
